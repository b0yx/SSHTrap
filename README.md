# Professional SSH Server

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ssh-server.git
   cd ssh-server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install paramiko pyyaml
   ```

3. **Generate Host Key**:
   Create an RSA host key with `ssh-keygen`:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f host_key
   ```

4. **Create Configuration File**:
   Set up a `config.yaml` file with the following content:
   ```yaml
   host_key_file: host_key
   username: admin
   password: password123
   address: 0.0.0.0
   port: 22
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**:
   Execute the server script:
   ```bash
   python ssh_server.py
   ```

2. **Connect to the Server**:
   Use an SSH client to connect:
   ```bash
   ssh admin@<server-ip> -p 22
   ```

3. **Interact with the Shell**:
   Available commands after connecting:
   - `echo <message>`: Repeats input.
   - `time`: Shows current system time.
   - `whoami`: Displays the current user.
   - `sysinfo`: Shows system information.
   - `clear`: Clears the terminal.
   - `ipconfig`: Displays network configuration (Windows) or interfaces (Linux).
   - `netstat`: Shows active network connections.
   - `ping <host>`: Pings a specified host.
   - `traceroute <host>`: Traces the route to a host.
   - `hostname`: Displays the hostname and local IP.
   - `df`: Shows disk space usage.
   - `free`: Shows memory usage.
   - `uptime`: Displays system uptime and load.
   - `ps`: Lists running processes.
   - `top`: Displays resource usage.
   - `bye`: Exits the shell.

## Configuration

Manage server settings in the `config.yaml` file:

- `host_key_file`: Path to the RSA host key.
- `username`: Client authentication username.
- `password`: Client authentication password.
- `address`: Server bind address (default: `0.0.0.0`).
- `port`: Listening port (default: `22`).

## Logging

The server logs activities and errors to `ssh_server.log` and the console, including timestamps, log levels, and messages.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Security**: Avoid plaintext passwords. Use environment variables or a secure vault.
- **Host Key Management**: Store the host key file securely with proper permissions.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent command injection.
